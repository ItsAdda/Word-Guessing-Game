# Word Guessing Game

Hi there!  
This is a simple (and admittedly rough) word guessing game I made while learning Python.  
Itâ€™s nothing fancy, but it works â€” hope you enjoy it (if you even can, to be honest ðŸ˜…).

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Main.py
